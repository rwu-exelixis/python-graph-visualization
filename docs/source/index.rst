Graph Visualization for Python by Neo4j documentation
=====================================================

This is the documentation for the ``neo4j-viz`` Python library by Neo4j.
The library allows you to visualize graph data interactively in Python using a simple API.

The library wraps the `Neo4j Visualization JavaScript library (NVL) <https://neo4j.com/docs/nvl/current/>`_, and
provides additional features for working with graph data in Python.
Notably, there are convenience methods for importing data from `Pandas DataFrames <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_,
`Neo4j Graph Data Science <https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/>`_ and `Neo4j Database <https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/>`_.

The source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/neo4j/python-graph-visualization>`_.
If you have a suggestion on how we can improve the library or want to report a problem, you can create a `new issue <https://github.com/neo4j/python-graph-visualization/issues/new>`_.
